## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

In today's fast-paced digital world, online shopping has become a crucial aspect of retail. Multivendor ecommerce platforms host a wide range of products from various vendors, making it challenging for users to discover items that align with their preferences. Recommender systems play a pivotal role in addressing this issue by suggesting personalized product recommendations to users.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The main challenge is to design and implement an effective recommender system for a multivendor ecommerce platform that enhances the user experience by offering tailored product recommendations. The system should consider factors such as user preferences, historical data, and product attributes to provide accurate and relevant suggestions.

### 1.3 Objectives

- Develop a multivendor ecommerce platform prototype.
- Implement collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches for recommendation.
- Evaluate the performance of the recommendation algorithms using relevant metrics.
- Gather user feedback to assess the system's usability and effectiveness.

### 1.4 Scope

This project will focus on the design, implementation, and evaluation of a recommender system for a multivendor ecommerce platform. The system will be developed as a prototype, showcasing the core functionalities of recommendation algorithms and user interactions.
